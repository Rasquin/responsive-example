Challenge

Using a mobile-first approach, make a webpage responsive in line with the following guidelines. In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.

1 Make the div elements 30% of the window size. Now make this change only for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px
2 Set the margin to 10px on all sides for each column for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px
3 Keep the full-size width for the devices below the 992px
4 Remove the left and right margin for the devices below the 992px

Remember to keep in mind the mobile-first approach
